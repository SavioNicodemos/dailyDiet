## Technical Skills

### Navigation

All navigation in the app was made with [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) using Stack Navigator.

Expo Router is a file-based router for React Native and web applications. It allows us to manage the navigation similar to the Next.js 'pages' router, with a file-based approach, allowing us to have way easier error handlings on the screens, tests and automatic deeplink for all pages.

### Stylish

The styles in the app was made with Styled Components. An css-in-js library that allows us to write css exactly as it is in the web directly in the Typescript, allowing us to have very customizable components.
